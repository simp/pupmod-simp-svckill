## This is a SIMP module
This module is a component of the
[System Integrity Management Platform](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP),
a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our
[JIRA](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

Please read our [Contribution Guide](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP)
and visit our [developer wiki](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/SIMP+Development+Home).

This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP ecosystem, but it
can be used independently:
* When included within the SIMP ecosystem, security compliance settings will be
managed from the Puppet server.
* In the future, all SIMP-managed security subsystems will be disabled by
default and must be explicitly opted into by administrators.  Please review
*simp/simp_options* for details.

## Module Description

Svckill is a system that attempts to run with the security best practice that
"No unnecessary services should be running on the system."

The way svckill works is to fetch all services on the running system and then
shutdown and disable any that are not declared in a Puppet manifest (or ignore
list/file) somewhere.

## Setup

### What simp svckill affects

*simp/svckill* effects ALL services on a given node. If this class is included
on a node, all services not declared in a puppet service resource or a svckill
ignore list will be disabled and turned off on a system. The following are
exceptions:

```
    The following services are hard coded to never be killed by svckill:
      * amtu
      * blk-availability
      * crond
      * ebtables
      * gpm
      * haldaemon
      * ip6tables
      * iptables
      * irqbalance
      * killall
      * libvirt-guests
      * lvm2-monitor
      * mcstrans
      * mdmonitor
      * messagebus
      * netcf-transaction
      * netfs
      * netlabel
      * network
      * ntpdate
      * portreserve
      * puppet
      * restorecond
      * sandbox
      * sshd
      * sysstat
      * udev-post
      * getty*
      * dbus*

   These are here because their status function is broken
      * krb524
      * mdmpd
      * readahead_later
      * rawdevices
      * lm_sensors
      * kudzu
```

### Beginning with svckill

You can set up svckill on a node by:

```puppet
include 'svckill'
```

## Usage

### I have a service I don't want puppet to kill on a single node

There are two ways to solve this problem:

Declare the service in puppet:

```puppet
service { 'myservice':
  ensure => running,
}
```

or Declare the service in an ignore list in svckill:

```puppet
svckill { 'myservice':
  ignore => ['myservice'],
}
```

### I want to ignore a list of services I deploy in a file

```puppet
svckill { 'ourservices':
  ignorefiles => '/opt/services',
}
```

### I want to set a list of services allowed in my entire infrascture

```puppet
site.pp

class { 'svckill':
  ignore => ['A',
             'B',
             'C'
            ],
}
```

### I don't want to kill a service, but I'd like to be alerted when it is running

```puppet
class { 'svckill':
  ignore => 'A',
  mode   => 'warning',
}
```

## Reference

### Types
* ['svckill'](#svckill-type): Type used to declare services to ignore.

### Public Classes
* ['svckill'](#svckill-class): Main class used to set up a set of default
services to ignore in an infrastructure.
* ['svckill::ignore'](#svckillignore): Ensure a service will not be killed by
svckill
* ['svckill::ignore::collector'](#svckillignorecollector): Build default ignore
file for svckill
